# pikachu_run

This is a chrome extension. From time to time, Pikachu will run across your webpages to say hello. You can choose between a fast and slow speed and determine how often Pikachu appears. I prefer to give Pikachu a 1% chance of appearing and a fast speed, so that it's a nice surprise when he comes through and it isn't too disruptive. 

The extension injects a canvas at the top of the body then draws the sprite running across. It accesses chrome's local storage to save settings.

This extension is available on the Chrome Web Store as "Hello Pikachu"!
