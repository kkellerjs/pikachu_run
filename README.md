# pikachu_run

This is a chrome extension. Post-installation, Pikachu might (there's a 1/3 chance) run across the screen to say hello when you load a new page. The extension injects a canvas at the top of the body then draws the sprite running across. It can be turned off and on by accessing local storage.
